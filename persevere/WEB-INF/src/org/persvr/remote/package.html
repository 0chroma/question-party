<p>Provides the main facilities for external interaction through the HTTP interface.
PersevereFilter is the central request handler, and provides much of the logic for handling
different types of HTTP requests and their various headers and formats. PersevereFitler
delegates execution to appropriate systems based on the requests (for example, PUTs trigger
JSON parsing, handling, and consequently property modifications). Eventually, we would
like to implement much of this in JavaScript for greater control and handling of requests
from the JavaScript environment.</p>

<p>
JSONSerializer is an important class for serializing objects to JSON and JavaScript form.
JsonReceiver handles interpretation of parsed JSON and mapping the JSON to the proper
objects in Persevere and making modifications to those objects based on the JSON received.
RequestHelper is a helper class for PersevereFilter for handling authentication and leveraging
JsonReceiver for handling JSON data from requests.</p>

<p>The Client class holds much of the stateful interaction used by Persevere, maintaining
transactions across requests, authentication users, client-side generated ids, and waiting RPC messages. It also
extends EventStream to provide a channel for messages that need to be delivered to clients
through the Comet notification system. The Client is similar to a session, but can be specific to a
page/client-side JS environment (each page can have it's own Client).</p>
