<p>Provides the various data source plugins that can be used with Persevere. Persevere
is designed to work with various storage systems. Several data source implementations
come with Persevere. The default data source
used by Persevere is the JavaScriptDBSource (most of the implementation is in JavaScriptDB).
There are data sources for working with SQL databases like MySQLDataSource and
DatabaseTableDataSource. Persevere can also connect to other HTTP servers through the
HttpJsonSource. The LocalJsonSource is used to read and write the config files used by
Persevere.</p>

<p>
Custom sources can be created as well. A data source plugin should at least
implement the DataSource interface for read access, and should also implement
the WritableDataSource interface. There are a number of other interfaces that can be
implemented for additional functionality.
</p>

<p>In the future, I would like to support a JavaScript API for data sources as well</p>
