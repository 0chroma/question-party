<p>Provides the core functionality for Persevere's JavaScript integration and
object behavior. PersistableObject is the primary class that provides the
ability to track property changes, handle accessing properties and triggering
lazy loading of references objects, and loading properties from the database
into objects. All JavaScript objects that are created in Persevere's JS
environment (through object literals or constructors) are instances of PersistableObject.
This class works in conjunction with the Transaction class to
facilitates transactions. The changes that are made to objects are stored in
Transaction instances and delivered to the database on commits.

<p>PersistableArray provides same type of functionality as PersistableObject, but for
arrays. QueryArray is a special array that is used for query results, and is specifically
designed for lazy loading, so that large query sets can be traversed without having
to load the entire result set into memory. The QueryArray does not actually store
any values inside of it, but rather connects to List implementators from data sources
for memory efficient query result access.</p>

<p>The Method class is used to wrap all functions that are stored on objects, so
that method definitions can be used for type checking and enhanced method execution
such as remote JSON-RPC calls. Observable methods are then tracked through ObservedCall
instances that are stored on the Transaction for distribution to any subscribers</p>


<p>The Indentification class is used to hold references to values. The ObjectId is
a subclass that holds references to particular objects. Each persisted object has
a single ObjectId and vice versa. The ObjectId class is important for Persevere's
soft referencing memory management that ensures that only a single instance of an
object is loaded into memory for a given id. The ObjectId holds a reference to the
object if it is still in memory, and if not, it can trigger the loading of the object
from the database. JsonPath is another subclass of Identification, which uses JSONQuery
evaluation to retrieve it's target. Query is another subclass that is used to pass
filters and sort operations to the data sources.
</p>

<p>The DataSourceManager is the bootstrap class that determines the file paths and
loads the data source definitions and initializes their data sources.</p>

<p>ConsoleLibrary, PjsLibrary, GlobalData, and RestMethod all provide native library
functions for the JavaScript environment. GlobalData is frequently used for accessing
the Persevere's single global scope object.</p>
