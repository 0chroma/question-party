This folder contains various data stores and store wrappers that implement 
the [WebSimpleDB](http://www.w3.org/TR/WebSimpleDB/) API. These data 
stores form the underlying storage for the Pintura framework. Data stores provide
facilities for accessing, querying, and storing data. Data store wrappers can augment
other stores with extra functionality.
