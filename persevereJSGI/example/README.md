This is an example Wiki built with Persevere 2.0. It is recommended that you 
use [Nodules](http://github.com/kriszyp/nodules) on Node to run this example so that
all dependencies will be automatically resolved, or you can also use the nightly 
build that bundles with Narwhal. Once installed, you can download this package and from
the root folder simply run:

    node /path/to/nodules.js
    
or for Narwhal:

    jackup
