questionparty.com doesn't seem to exist anymore, but we liked the idea, so we decided to redo it.

The idea behind question party is simple: the user goes to the site, and gets presented with a question. They answer the question, and get to see what other people's answers were. They then get presented with another question, and the cycle continues until the user becomes bored and closes the window. The questions can be pulled from RSS feeds specified in the configuration file.
