questionparty.com doesn't seem to exist anymore, but we liked the idea, so we decided to redo it.

This is a Twisted Python app. Requires the following:

python
twisted http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/
twisted-web http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/TwistedWeb
txJSON-RPC http://pypi.python.org/pypi/txJSON-RPC/

to run, do the following command:
    twistd -ny qp/questionparty.tac
